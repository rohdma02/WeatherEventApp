//Mateus Rohden --> MR

Ideas to name the web app
MR-City Explorer app, City, Weather and Events app

How to present the data
MR-One div with the Weather Data and maybe an icon, animation....
MR-One div with a table of the events Data(title, city, time, link)
MR-One div with the history of the cities searched in the local storage, after clicking
in one of them it automatically display the data in the weather div and the events div about that city.

MR-Finish a lot in the front end part and started the MVC pattern,
not sure if it is correct but so far it works when you search for city, it 
display the weather about the city and nearby events.

-MR-Finish a lot of the backend part, local storage, and finihsed the MVC pattern,
delete function, history of cities function, clean the code a little bit, when a city is added it automatically display the history of the searched cities.
When a city is deleted it Today weather and Today events should be back to initial part
Remove all function
Reset the search city input after searched.
Change the Today weather/events in {cityName} 
When removed all, the info for weather and events is empty
Error handling, invalid cities, invalid input for city.
